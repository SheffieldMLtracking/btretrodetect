# retrodetect
- This new version (completely rewritten) assumes all the photos are flash photos.
- Also handles colour camera!

# install
[to add]

# usage
One passes a path and the tool will recursively search through the subdirectories, finding all the images, sorting them (within that folder) and applying the retrodetect algorithm.

Example:
```btretrodetect ~/Documents/Research/rsync_bee/test/beephotos/2023-06-29/sessionA/setA/cam5/02D49670796/ --after 10:32:29 --before 10:33:29 --threshold -10```

```usage: btretrodetect [-h] [--after AFTER] [--before BEFORE] [--refreshcache] [--threshold THRESHOLD] [--sourcename SOURCENAME] imgpath

Runs the retoreflector detection algorithm

positional arguments:
  imgpath               Path to images (it will recursively search for images in these paths)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --after AFTER         Only process images that were created after this time HH:MM:SS
  --before BEFORE       Only process images that were created before this time HH:MM:SS
  --refreshcache        Whether to refresh the cache
  --threshold THRESHOLD
                        Threshold of score before adding to data
  --sourcename SOURCENAME
                        The name to give this source of labels (default:retrodetect)```
```
# workflow

1. Use `btqviewer .` to label bees (this makes a folder, btviewer, in the places where you do this).
2. Use `btretrodetect-train .` in this location (ideally across a session or set, i.e. from multiple cameras). This by default replaces the current model with a new one (saves the old one with a different name).
3. Try out `btretrodetect` on a new dataset.
4. Load the new dataset with btqviewer to see how it does.
